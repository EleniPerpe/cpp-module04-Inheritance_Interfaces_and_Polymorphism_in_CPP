This project is a C++ exercise in object-oriented programming, focusing on polymorphism, inheritance, abstract classes, and interfaces. The task involves implementing a series of animal classes, Materia classes, and character interactions with the aim to practice object-oriented concepts in real-world applications. The exercises involve class design, deep copying, abstract base classes, interfaces, and managing memory properly to avoid leaks.
